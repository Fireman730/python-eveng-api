curl -s -c /tmp/cookie -b /tmp/cookie -X POST -d '{"count":1,"name":"Net-R1iface_0","type":"bridge","left":441,"top":658,"visibility":1,"postfix":0}' -H 'Content-type: application/json' http://127.0.0.1/api/labs/User1/Folder 2/Different Lab.unl/networks

when all is done ( net, node1 and node2 to net) , change visibility to 0
use PUT method
something like:
curl -s -c /tmp/cookie -b /tmp/cookie -X PUT -d '{"visibility":0}' -H 'Content-type: application/json' http://127.0.0.1/api/labs/User1/Folder 2/Different Lab.unl/networks/1
