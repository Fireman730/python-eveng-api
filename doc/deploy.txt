I didn't find on API Documentation how it is possible to connect two devices between us.
There are endpoints for "Add Network" and "Add Nodes".
But there is no information about "How connect network to a device"

I wrote to EVE-NG team but for the moment -> no answer

I wrote a function that will retrieve the Lab XML and modify this file.
The function works for Cumulus and ./architecture/all.yml lab.
I didn't test this function for other lab.

Please keep in mind that is not a really good method.
Don't implement this function in production !!

You can run :
./eveng-api.py --deploy=./architecture/all.yml
